# LeagueManager
Final Degree Project in Multi-platform Application Development.

The main objective is to develop a project in which a football league can be fully managed.
It is divided into 2 separate projects, linked by the same database:

- A desktop application, which will be the "data generator" and will provide the database with all the resources needed. In this case, those resources will be Teams, Players,
Competitions and Users such as Trainers and Referees. It will also be able to generate the matches of a competition according to the type of it. There will be 2 types; Leagues
and Tournaments. The leagues will be single round-robin and the tournaments will be single-elimination.

- A website, where anyone will be able to see all of the data mentioned above.
